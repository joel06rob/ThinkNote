## Introduction
**Thinknote** is a simple to do list web application with a twist. Often times I found myself coming up with project ideas and writing them down in a notes app, there they would sit collecting dust and in most cases I never took action on any of them. **Thinknote** offers an engaging way to jot down your ideas, detail them and track them.

This was my first main Javascript project that I built whilst learning the language. Throughout the development I was continuously learning which brought many challenges (more on this later), however the project was a success.
